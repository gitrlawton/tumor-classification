Classify brain tumors from MRI scans.

Two parts.

Part 1:

- Downloading, understanding, and pre-processing the dataset.
- Training the Transfer Learning model.
- Training the CNN model.
- Evaluating the models.

Part 2:

- Building the web app using Streamlit to get predictions from the model and visualize which areas of the MRI scans are important for making the predictions.
- Creating the UI and visualizations.
- Generating explanations using Gemini 1.5 flash explain what is going on in the MRI scan to further better understand the models predictions.

This project combines classical machine-learning and generative AI -- training deep-learning models to classify the brain tumors and using multi-modal large language models to explain the models predictions.
